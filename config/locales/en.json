Dangers are not necessarily reported and information mentioned is not everytime verified. Caving is a discipline with many facets: cultural, science and sports. In the latter capacity, it often requires a physical commitment. It is also not free of risks, and even major risks. These risks, if they can not be completely eliminated, are at least greatly reduced by a practice in the rules, practice which is fully understood when under a caving club (grotto). In any case GROTTOCENTER and its team can not be held liable for a bad practice of caving. The novice who would engage in underground exploration is urged to contact a caving club.
